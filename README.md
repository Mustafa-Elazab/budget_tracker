# Budget Tracker
A Simple Budget Tracker App built to demonstrate the use of modern android architecture component with MVVM Architecture
### Project Features

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.

    -  [Stateflow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - StateFlow is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
    -    [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html)- A flow is an asynchronous version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
    -  [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
   -  [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - SQLite object mapping library.
   - [Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app
   - [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.

[Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.

### Architecture 
This app uses [MVVM (Model View View-Model)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.
